        <h2>an amazing animation seria by Sun Creature Studio</h2>
            <p>The Tales of Alethrion is an animation seria by Sun Creature Studio. It's an offspring from the shortmovie "The Reward", which was a great success. That led to a kickstarter campaign, to set of enough funds for the project. Because of many backers, the project was finalized late 2013.</p>

            <h1>Project details</h1>
            <p>Sun Creature Studio needed a website for the new seria "The Tales of Alethrion". They wanted it to display the world around the seria, and give a feeling, that you were inside the world, when you visited the page. The page gives the opportunity for display things such as fanart and merchandize.</p>
