            <h1>Project details</h1>
            <p>Mathias Winum needed an online portfolio, that would display creativity. The page is a bit different than normal, and consist of boubles that swaps to the side, when visitors navigate around the site. This was to show creativity, and try to create something that stands out.</p>

        <div class="fact-column">
            <h1>Technical details</h1>
            <p>The website is a onepager, that swaps pages with transitions. The background is a hand drawn painting, that was painted for the purpose of the portfolio. Mathias wanted a look of fantasy and sci-fi, so it was decided to make a full background image, that gives that feeling.<br /> The site is not responsive.</p>
