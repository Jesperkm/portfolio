    <h1>Sun Creature Studio</h1>
        <h2>an epic bromance creative studio</h2>
            <p>Sun Creature Studio is an animation studio located in Viborg, Denmark. They made a popular shortmovie called "The Reward". Based on the shortmovie, they started a kickstarter campain, to gather enough money to make a seria called "Tales of Alehtrion", which succeded. My assignment was to create a business website, that would brand their company.</p>

            <h1>Project details</h1>
            <p>Sun Creature Studio needed a website, that would both brand them as an awsome animation company, and be a connection point for all their work. They wanted to be able to display the work they've done, but only as a quick overview, since they wanted separate subpages for their seias. </p>
